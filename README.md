- I think Sarah and Caroline have created quit interesting and useful course for beginners. The course allows students to become confident at basic operations and terminology. Maybe some powerful possibilites of Git were being left without attention but I've received a strong foundation to move forward. 

- Octocats story by CodeSchool is stylish and informative. I've gone through with pleasure.
