# Task 0

- I think Sarah and Caroline have created quit interesting and useful course for beginners. The course allows students to become confident at basic operations and terminology. Maybe some powerful possibilites of Git were being left without attention but I've received a strong foundation to move forward. 

- Octocats story by CodeSchool is stylish and informative. I've gone through with pleasure.


# Task 1

- [Linux Command Line Basics](/Test_01/Test_1_1.png)
- [Configuring Linux Web Servers](/Test_01/Test_1_2.png)
- [Networking for Web Developers](/Test_01/Test_1_3.png)

These courses were full of new information for me. Also they stimulated to search more details about described tools. For example I founded out that virtualisation technology was disabled initially in my HP laptop BIOS.

- HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1

Many details of HTTP specification were new for me. It was surprising that HTTP protocol was so successfully designed that it has so short history of release versions. Tools to monitor HTTP communication named in the article will be the thing I intend to use in the future.

- HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2

Possability to manage cashing and freshness from server and client sides was new for me. Article describes common design principals which can be useful in future for better understanding of their practical realisation in various API.
